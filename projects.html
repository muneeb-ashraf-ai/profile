        <h2>Student Management System</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project is a Student Management System, a RESTful API built with FastAPI. It handles student, course, and enrollment data using CRUD operations. The system features secure JWT-based user authentication with role-based access control (Admin vs. regular user) and password hashing. It uses SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database for data persistence and Pydantic for data validation.</p>

        <h2>Chess Game Engine</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project is a simple command-line Chess Game Engine implemented in Python. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create an 8x8 chessboard and represent chess pieces as objects with their unique movement logic. The engine handles player turns, validates moves (e.g., preventing friendly fire and illegal paths), and provides a basic text-based interface for gameplay. Key features include an abstract Piece class and subclasses for each chess piece, showcasing concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. Future improvements could include special moves and a graphical interface.</p>

        <h2>House Price Prediction</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project is focused on predicting house prices using various machine learning models. It evaluates and compares the performance of linear, non-linear, and tree-based regression models on a dataset containing features like area, bedrooms, and location. The project's key steps include data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance evaluation using metrics like $R^2$ score, MAE, and MSE. The analysis concluded that Gradient Boosting and Random Forest Regressor were the top-performing models due to their superior accuracy in capturing non-linear relationships. The project suggests future improvements like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to further enhance model performance.</p>

        <h2>Heart Disease Prediction</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project tackles heart disease prediction using machine learning. It uses clinical and demographic data like age and cholesterol levels to build and evaluate four models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical ones. Random Forest Classifier was found to be the most accurate model, achieving 89% accuracy. Future work involves using techniques like hyperparameter tuning and exploring boosting algorithms.</p>

        <h2>Brain Tumor Detection</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images, classifying them as either "present" or "absent". The model, built with TensorFlow and Keras, was trained on a preprocessed dataset of images resized to 64x64 pixels. After training for 10 epochs, the CNN achieved an accuracy of 98.79% with a loss of 0.0924. The model can be saved and reloaded to predict on new images.</p>

        <h2>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project is a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud using a Random Forest Classifier. It analyzes transaction data, including anonymized features from PCA, time, and amount. To address data imbalance, it balances the dataset by matching the number of fraudulent and normal transactions. The model achieved an accuracy of 93.9% and was evaluated with a confusion matrix and classification report to confirm its ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.</p>

        <h2>Student Performance Analysis</h2>
        <div class="project-details">
          <p>This project uses Multiple Linear Regression to predict a student's Performance Index based on a Kaggle dataset. Key features analyzed include studying hours, sleep habits, and extracurricular activities. The process involved data preprocessing (cleaning, label encoding), correlation analysis, and model training. The model achieved a high $R^2$ score of 91.6%, with visualizations confirming a strong relationship between the chosen features and academic performance.</p>
